Brought to you by Souricette (daniel@chiaramello.net), last update: 2005-03-12</br>

What is it???</br>
</br>
NWN Tool is a MacOS X and Windows Application which lets you do various things on Neverwinter Night's files (modules, haks, .erf files and .nwm files):</br>
- show information on the file
- edit the different conversations
- edit the different Journal entries
- edit the different Creatures name and description
- edit the different Area names
- edit the different Item name and descriptions
- export all the different strings in a Text file, to let you edit them and reimport them back with the changes
- localize all these strings for specific languages, using the Export/Import feature</br>
</br>
New for version 2.0:</br>
- edit a character (.bic) file</br>
- view and export all the minimaps of a given module</br>
</br>
New from version 2.0.1:</br>
- export a character (.bic) file to a text file, based on user-customizable export template file</br>
- NWN campaign strings are now correctly displayed!</br>
- minimaps of the NWN campaigns are now also viewable/exportable!</br>
</br>
</br>
WARNING: This application will NOT let you ADD new things in a module (you still need Aurora Toolset for that), it will "only" enable you to edit existing things and create new localizations for existing things.</br>
</br>
WARNING FOR WINDOWS USERS: This application is developed on Macintosh. All the layouts of the windows are created on these computers, and "uglily" used for Windows target. That's why you will probably consider that application as "badly designed", because you are likely to find weird button or text positionning - well, that's the price to have a Windows version...</br>
